## ðŸ’¡ About the project

>This project is about creating a simple shell.
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.



## ðŸ’» To use the program 
<h3>you must first compile it with the makefile by using the command 'make' in the shell</h3>

```bash
make all
```

<h3>Then the program must be executed as follows: </h3>

```bash
./minishell
```

**You can now try all the different functionalities !**

## ðŸ“‹ Functionalities

- Prompt Display: Displays a **prompt** when waiting for a new command.
- History: Maintains a working **history of commands**.
- Executable Search: **Searches and launches the correct executable** based on the PATH variable or using a relative or absolute path.
- Quote Handling: Handles **single quotes** (```'```) and **double quotes** (```"```) to prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence, with the exception of the dollar sign (```$```) in double quotes.
- **Redirections**: Implements input (```<```), output (```>```), append mode output (```>>```) redirections, and delimiter-based input (```<<```).
- **Pipes**: Implements pipes (```|```) to connect the output of each command in the pipeline to the input of the next command.
- **Environment Variables**: Handles environment variables and expands them to their values. Also handles ```?``` which expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- **Key Handling**: Handles ```ctrl-C```, ```ctrl-D```, and ```ctrl-\``` keys like in bash. In interactive mode, ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line, ctrl-D exits the shell, and ctrl-\ does nothing.
- **Builtins**: Implements builtins including echo with option -n, cd with only a relative or absolute path, pwd with no options, export with no options, unset with no options, env with no options or arguments, and exit with no options.
